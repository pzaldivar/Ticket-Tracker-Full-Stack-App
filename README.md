A functional app for engineers to create, delete and close issues and tickets.

Tech used: EJS

How It's Made:
This app started off as a simple app using HTML and basic CSS and later evolved into a full-stack app using solely the MVC structure, EJS language and Bootstrap template.

Lessons Learned:
I learned more about how Bootstrap works and why it's used as an alternative to CSS. I also got more practice with creating a functional full-stack app that can be used in a workplace to help organize and facilitate work tasks.
